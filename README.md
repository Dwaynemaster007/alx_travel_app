## ‚ú® Project Overview

Welcome to the **alx_travel_app**! This project is a robust, real-world Django application designed to be the foundation for a powerful travel listing platform. Our mission is to build a scalable and secure backend that sets the standard for modern web development.

This repository represents the crucial first milestone, where we've focused on creating a production-ready setup from the ground up.

## üåü Key Features

* **Django-Powered Backend:** Built on the reliable and feature-rich Django framework.
* **RESTful API:** Developed with Django REST Framework for clean, well-structured API endpoints.
* **MySQL Database:** Utilizes a robust relational database for secure and efficient data management.
* **API Documentation:** Integrated with **Swagger UI** (`drf-yasg`) for automatic, interactive, and beautifully documented API endpoints. 
* **Secure Configuration:** Employs `django-environ` to handle sensitive data via `.env` files, ensuring secrets are never committed to the repository.
* **CORS Headers:** Configured with `django-cors-headers` for seamless cross-origin resource sharing.
